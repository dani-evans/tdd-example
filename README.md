# TDD Example

This project is to help you get an understanding of the principles of Test-Driven
Development and Continuous Integration.

## Getting Started

### GitHub

 1. Go to [GitHub.com](http://github.com) and create an account (if you don't have one already).
 2. Fork the [TDD Example project](https://github.com/riggerthegeek/tdd-example)

### Cloud9

 1. Go to [Cloud9](https://c9.io/) and create an account.  It's easiest to create it with your GitHub account as this will link your GitHub account (this becomes important later).
 2. You should see the tdd-example project in your list of projects on GitHub on the left hand side.  Select it and click `Clone To Edit`.  It's a NodeJS project, so make sure that's selected (this will take a couple of minutes).  Eventually, a `start editing` button will appear.

### Developing
 1. On your IDE screen, you will see a terminal.  In that, type `npm install`.  This will install your dependencies (such as Mocha and Chai testing frameworks).
 2. To run the test framework, you need only type `npm test`.  This will run all your Unit Tests and output the result.
